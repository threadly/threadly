/**
 * <p>Similar to {@link RateLimiterExecutor} except that the rate is applied on a per key basis.  
 * Tasks submitted to this executor must all be associated to a key.  The key is compared by using 
 * {@link Object#hashCode()} and {@link Object#equals(Object)}.  For any given key, a rate is 
 * applied, but keys which don't match with the above checks will not impact each other.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Because different keys don't interact, this is not capable of providing a global rate limit 
 * (unless the key quantity is known and restricted).</p>
 * 
 * <p>This differs from {@link KeyedExecutorLimiter} in that while that limits concurrency, this 
 * limits by rate (thus there may be periods where nothing is execution, or if executions are long 
 * things may run concurrently).  Please see {@link RateLimiterExecutor} for more details about how 
 * rate is limited.</p>
