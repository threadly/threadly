/**
 * <p>This class is designed to limit how much parallel execution happens on a provided 
 * {@link Executor}.  This allows the user to have one thread pool for all their code, and if they 
 * want certain sections to have less levels of parallelism (possibly because those those sections 
 * would completely consume the global pool), they can wrap the executor in this class.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Thus providing you better control on the absolute thread count and how much parallelism can 
 * occur in different sections of the program.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This is an alternative from having to create multiple thread pools.  By using this you also 
 * are able to accomplish more efficiently thread use than multiple thread pools would.</p>
