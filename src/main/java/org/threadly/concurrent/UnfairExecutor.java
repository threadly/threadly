/**
 * <p>A very high performance {@link SubmitterExecutor} implementation.  Though to get those 
 * performance gains, some guarantees are reduced.  Most prominently is execution order, this 
 * scheduler does not ensure that tasks are executed in the order they are submitted, but rather 
 * tasks are consumed however is fastest.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This executor has an execution queue per thread.  That way each thread has a many producer, 
 * one consumer safety guarantees.  Compared to other pools which have to deal with a many to many 
 * thread safety issue.  Determining the thread queue may be based on a variety of information.  A 
 * couple built in distrubtion solutions are {@link TaskHashXorTimeStripeGenerator} (default) and 
 * {@link AtomicStripeGenerator}.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This scheduler will work best when the following conditions are true.  First because a long 
 * running task can block other tasks from running (even when other threads are idle).  It is best 
 * that tasks should be equally sized.  We also recommend having thread counts which are prime 
 * numbers for a more even hash distribution.  It is also important to recognize that it is 
 * generally a bad idea to block any of these threads waiting for results from processing that is 
 * expected to happen on the same executor.</p>
