/**
 * <p>Abstract implementation for scheduled keyed limiters.  Unlike the other limiters we can not 
 * extend off of each one, and just add extra functionality.  Instead they must extend these 
 * abstract classes.  The reason for that being that these types of limiters use the other 
 * limiters, rather than extend functionality off each other.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This adds scheduling functionality.  It must exist in an abstract form because of the need 
 * to type the limiter type for specific functionality in the specific limiter type (casting is 
 * ugly, which would be the alternative).</p>
