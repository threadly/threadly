/**
 * This class is designed to limit how much parallel execution happens 
 * on a provided {@link SimpleSchedulerInterface}.  This allows the 
 * implementor to have one thread pool for all their code, and if 
 * they want certain sections to have less levels of parallelism 
 * (possibly because those those sections would completely consume the 
 * global pool), they can wrap the executor in this class.
 * 
 * Thus providing you better control on the absolute thread count and 
 * how much parallelism can occur in different sections of the program.  
 * 
 * Thus avoiding from having to create multiple thread pools, and also 
 * using threads more efficiently than multiple thread pools would.
