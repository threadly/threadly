/**
 * <p>This class is designed to limit how much parallel execution happens on a provided 
 * {@link SchedulerService}.  This allows the implementor to have one thread pool for all 
 * their code, and if they want certain sections to have less levels of parallelism (possibly 
 * because those those sections would completely consume the global pool), they can wrap the 
 * executor in this class.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Thus providing you better control on the absolute thread count and how much parallelism can 
 * occur in different sections of the program.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This is an alternative from having to create multiple thread pools.  By using this you also 
 * are able to accomplish more efficiently thread use than multiple thread pools would.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This extends the {@link SubmitterSchedulerLimiter} to add {@link SchedulerService} 
 * features.  This does not cause any performance hits, but does require a source 
 * {@link SchedulerService} to rely on.  If you have a {@link SchedulerService} 
 * available this implementation should be preferred over the {@link SubmitterSchedulerLimiter}.</p>
