/**
 * Executor to run tasks, schedule tasks.  Unlike 
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor} this scheduled executor's pool size 
 * can shrink if set with a lower value via {@link #setPoolSize(int)}.  It also has the benefit 
 * that you can provide "low priority" tasks.
 * <p>
 * These low priority tasks will delay their execution if there are other high priority tasks 
 * ready to run, as long as they have not exceeded their maximum wait time.  If they have exceeded 
 * their maximum wait time, and high priority tasks delay time is less than the low priority delay 
 * time, then those low priority tasks will be executed.  What this results in is a task which has 
 * lower priority, but which wont be starved from execution.
 * <p>
 * Most tasks provided into this pool will likely want to be "high priority", to more closely 
 * match the behavior of other thread pools.  That is why unless specified by the constructor, the 
 * default {@link TaskPriority} is High.
 * <p>
 * In all conditions, "low priority" tasks will never be starved.  This makes "low priority" tasks 
 * ideal which do regular cleanup, or in general anything that must run, but cares little if there 
 * is a 1, or 10 second gap in the execution time.  That amount of tolerance is adjustable by 
 * setting the {@code maxWaitForLowPriorityInMs} either in the constructor, or at runtime via 
 * {@link #setMaxWaitForLowPriority(long)}.
