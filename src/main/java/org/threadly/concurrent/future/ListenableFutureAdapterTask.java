/**
 * Adapter from java's {@link Future} to threadly's {@link ListenableFuture}.  This transfers the 
 * state (ie result, failure, or canceled) from the source future.  In order for this translation 
 * to occur a thread is needed to notify potential listeners when the future completes.  When 
 * {@link ListenableFutureTask#run()} is invoked we will block (if delegate future is not complete) 
 * waiting for the result from the provided future.  Completing with the same state once the 
 * provided future completes.
 * <p>
 * The most common way to use this class is to construct it with the future to adapt from, then 
 * provide this future to an executor to block waiting for the provided future to complete.  If 
 * this is used for high quantities keep in mind a lot of the threads will idly be waiting for 
 * results, typically a native threadly pool may be a better option.
 * 
 * @param <T> Type of result returned from the future
