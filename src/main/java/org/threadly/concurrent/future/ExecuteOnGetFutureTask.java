/**
 * This future task has a special ability to start execution in the thread requesting the 
 * {@link #get()} IF it has not already started.  It is still expected that this future will be 
 * provided to an executor, but if that executor has been unable to start execution by the time 
 * {@link #get()} is requested, execution will start on the {@link #get()} thread.
 * <p>
 * This can make sense if for example you need to have the result of a given future before you can 
 * go forward with additional work.  That way if the thread pool is too busy with other things, we 
 * can try to get the result for this work unit as fast as possible (once we are ready for it).  
 * If execution starts on the {@link #get()} call, once the task is started in the thread pool, it 
 * will return immediately (WITHOUT invoking the task contained in the future).
 * <p>
 * This does come with some details to be aware of.  Execution may only occur on the 
 * {@link #get()} request.  Requesting {@link #get(long, java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit)} will NOT 
 * cause execution to start (as we can not ensure a timeout will be respected).  In addition this 
 * can not work with recurring tasks.
