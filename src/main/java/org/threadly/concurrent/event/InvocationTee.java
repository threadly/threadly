   * provided arguments are mutable, and an instance mutates that argument, future invoked 
   * instances may see that modification.  It is not deterministic which order the instances will 
   * be invoked in.  
   * 
   * If any listeners throw an exception it will be delegated to 
   * {@link org.threadly.util.ExceptionUtils#handleException(Throwable)}.  So a listener throwing 
   * an exception will NOT interrupt other listeners from being invoked.  If you want you can 
   * handle thrown exceptions by setting an {@link org.threadly.util.ExceptionHandler} into 
   * {@link org.threadly.util.ExceptionUtils}.  Make sure the handler is set it in a way that makes 
   * sense based off what thread will be invoking the returned interface.  
   * 
   * Under the hood this depends on {@link ListenerHelper}, and thus has the same limitations.  
   * Most specifically the provided {@code teeInterface} must in fact be an interface, and not a 
   * an abstract class, or other non-interface types.  In addition any invocations called to this 
   * must be a {@code void} return type.
