/**
 * Simple class for watching a condition and getting notified when a state has changed.  One handy 
 * tool is the ability to transition java's {@link Future} into Threadly's much nicer 
 * {@link ListenableFuture}.
 * <p>
 * The frequency at which this polls should be determined based off how cheap polling is, and how 
 * many items will be polled on average.
 * <p>
 * If being allowed to garbage collect, this poller will continue to schedule itself as long as
 * there are outstanding futures.  Once all have completed (from timeout or naturally), then this
 * will stop scheduling itself to poll for updates.  Thus no explicit cleanup is needed.  As long 
 * as the {@link Supplier}'s are quick/fast ({@link Future} conversions are always quick/fast), 
 * it's most efficient to reuse the {@link Poller} instance.  But if you need dynamic 
 * timeout's/max wait time you could construct a {@link Poller} and toss it away once you get the 
 * returned {@link ListenableFuture} from it.
